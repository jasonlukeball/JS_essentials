	<h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>    
    	<p>
    	This is a very simple HTML page.
    	</p>

	<p>It's about as basic as they come. It has:<p>

	<ul>
		<li>An H1 Tag</li>
		<li>Two paragraphs</li>
		<li>An unordered list</li>
	</ul>

    <!-- IT MATTERS WHERE YOU PUT THE JAVASCRIPT, IF THIS WERE AT THE TOP, THE JS WOULD EXECUTE BEFORE THE PAGE CONTENT LOADS  -->
    <!-- THE HTML & JS IS EXECUTED LINE BY LINE TOP TO BOTTOM -->
    <script>
        alert("Hello World!")
    </script>
</body>
